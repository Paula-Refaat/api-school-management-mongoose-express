## Introduction:
<p id="description">Our School Management Application aims to simplify and enhance the operational efficiency of educational institutions. Its core functionalities enable users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on three primary entities: School, Classrooms, Students</p>

## üíªTechnologies

Technologies and tools used in the project:
   * Node.js
   * express
   * MongoDB
   * mongoose
   * bcryptjs
   * dotenv
   * express-async-handler
   * express-validator
   * jsonwebtoken
   * morgan
   * multer
   * nodemailer
   * sharp
   * slugify

<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

* Authentication:
The authentication feature enables users to create an account, login, and manage their credentials securely. It includes functionalities such as user registration, login, password reset, and authentication token management. Users can access protected resources and perform actions based on their authorization level..

* Schools:
Schools serve as the foundational unit within the application, encapsulating all vital information about educational institutions. Superadmins, with their elevated privileges, can seamlessly add new schools to the system. This feature facilitates the expansion of educational networks while maintaining a centralized and organized record of each school's data.

* Classrooms:
Within each school, classrooms form the structural backbone. School administrators, referred to as "school admins," wield the power to oversee and manage classrooms within their respective schools. This control includes creating, updating, and deleting classroom information, adapting to the evolving needs of educational environments.es.

* Students:
The lifeblood of any educational institution is its student body. Within our application, school admins have the authority to manage students enrolled in their classrooms. This encompasses the ability to add, modify, and remove student data, thus ensuring up-to-date and accurate records.
